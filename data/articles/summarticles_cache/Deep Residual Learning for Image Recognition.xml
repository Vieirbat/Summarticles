depth, a question arises: Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers?</s><s xml:id="_ujPTmR6">An obstacle to answering this question was the notorious problem of vanishing/exploding gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, which hamper convergence from the beginning.</s><s xml:id="_3XRN7qC">This problem, however, has been largely addressed by normalized initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and intermediate normalization layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which enable networks with tens of layers to start converging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_RmtJdcG"><s xml:id="_duNFxDY">When deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly.</s><s xml:id="_QFQ5XMb">Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting, and adding more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training error, as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> and thoroughly verified by our experiments.</s><s xml:id="_TEVpQ8F">Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a typical example.</s></p><p xml:id="_QMUgcMz"><s xml:id="_bJ4T9uC">The degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that not all systems are similarly easy to optimize.</s><s xml:id="_HXbqQZD">Let us consider a shallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds more layers onto it.</s><s xml:id="_bXC5tkG">There exists a solution by construction to the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping, and the other layers are copied from the learned shallower model.</s><s xml:id="_78jUTUe">The existence of this constructed solution indicates that a deeper model should produce no higher training error than its shallower counterpart.</s><s xml:id="_AASG5Fa">But experiments show that our current solvers on hand are unable to find solutions that are comparably good or better than the constructed solution (or unable to do so in feasible time).</s></p><p xml:id="_maHkqKW"><s xml:id="_KufvFF9">In this paper, we address the degradation problem by introducing a deep residual learning framework.</s><s xml:id="_d22cbwU">Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping.</s><s xml:id="_5r4CWRU">Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as H(x), we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of F(x) := H(x) − x.</s><s xml:id="_hbXYGQ4">The original mapping is recast into F(x)+x.</s><s xml:id="_DHPpcZ9">We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping.</s><s xml:id="_mU4C7PE">To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.</s></p><p xml:id="_fhRJeAw"><s xml:id="_VeBnuEC">The formulation of F(x) + x can be realized by feedforward neural networks with "shortcut connections" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_p684eEG">Shortcut connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> are those skipping one or more layers.</s><s xml:id="_S46P9Yy">In our case, the shortcut connections simply perform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_BGH2Gut">Identity shortcut connections add neither extra parameter nor computational complexity.</s><s xml:id="_NhTNuZn">The entire network can still be trained end-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be easily implemented using common libraries (e.g., Caffe <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>) without modifying the solvers.</s></p><p xml:id="_MyHXQK3"><s xml:id="_Tak66WX">We present comprehensive experiments on ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> to show the degradation problem and evaluate our method.</s><s xml:id="_jvDSMVb">We show that: 1) Our extremely deep residual nets are easy to optimize, but the counterpart "plain" nets (that simply stack layers) exhibit higher training error when the depth increases; 2) Our deep residual nets can easily enjoy accuracy gains from greatly increased depth, producing results substantially better than previous networks.</s></p><p xml:id="_33YG4Sv"><s xml:id="_5nURGMb">Similar phenomena are also shown on the CIFAR-10 set <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, suggesting that the optimization difficulties and the effects of our method are not just akin to a particular dataset.</s><s xml:id="_dJd9AZy">We present successfully trained models on this dataset with over 100 layers, and explore models with over 1000 layers.</s></p><p xml:id="_UGe6bKK"><s xml:id="_rNZSNzE">On the ImageNet classification dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we obtain excellent results by extremely deep residual nets.</s><s xml:id="_2A6AYBr">Our 152layer residual net is the deepest network ever presented on ImageNet, while still having lower complexity than VGG nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BkMPgk5">Our ensemble has 3.57% top-5 error on the ImageNet test set, and won the 1st place in the ILSVRC 2015 classification competition.</s><s xml:id="_fStrUdc">The extremely deep representations also have excellent generalization performance on other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the 1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC &amp; COCO 2015 competitions.</s><s xml:id="_svd5xrF">This strong evidence shows that the residual learning

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="_sBecaKP">We have experimented with more training iterations (3×) and still observed the degradation problem, suggesting that this problem cannot be feasibly addressed by simply using more iterations.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="_FRBKmPf">Deeper non-bottleneck ResNets (e.g., Fig.5left) also gain accuracy from increased depth (as shown on CIFAR-10), but are not as economical as the bottleneck ResNets. So the usage of bottleneck designs is mainly due to practical considerations. We further note that the degradation problem of plain nets is also witnessed for the bottleneck designs.</note>
